 # Dom_project

## Description

This project focuses on improving the user experience (UX) and visual appeal of a web application's 
user interface (UI) <h5> Using JavaScript </h5>. It aims to maintain a consistent design across all elements, ensuring alignment
and aesthetics. Specific tasks include changing the background color of a designated div element to a 
vibrant yellow, applying a margin and padding for better spacing and readability, adjusting the font 
size to a comfortable 18 pixels and making it bold for emphasis. Furthermore, the height and width of the element
will be resized to 200 pixels and 300 pixels respectively, enhancing its overall dimensions.
